### Overview
In the vibrant world of music and machine learning, our project, "BanglaBeats," emerges as a harmonious fusion of technology and culture. Focusing on the rich and diverse landscape of Bangla music, we embarked on a journey to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of Bangla music genre classification.

### Comprehensive Dataset
At the heart of our project lies a meticulously curated dataset of Bangla songs. Comprising 1617 data samples spanning across 8 distinct genres, it forms the foundation upon which our research thrives.

### Innovative Approaches: 
We introduced cutting-edge techniques to tackle this intricate challenge. Our Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based approach emerged as a standout performer, achieving a remarkable accuracy rate of 88%. This achievement not only surpassed existing methods but also demonstrated the potential of CNNs in music genre classification.

### Fine-Tuned Transformers: 
We didn't stop there. We delved into the realm of transformer-based models, meticulously fine-tuning DistilHubert and Wav2Vec2-Base-960h. Our rigorous efforts yielded impressive results with 83% and 85% accuracy, respectively. These outcomes showcase the versatility of modern deep learning models in deciphering complex musical patterns.

### 	Future Horizons: 
Our journey continues as we explore advanced optimization techniques, aiming to push the boundaries of performance even further. We are committed to refining our approach, expanding our dataset, and contributing to the evolving landscape of music classification.

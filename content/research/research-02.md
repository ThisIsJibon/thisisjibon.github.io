### Overview

ADHD is characterized as one of the most prevalent neurodevelopmental conditions worldwide. Children with ADHD face many cognitive challenges in the social and academic context. In this regard, we hypothesize about e-learning-based technological intervention. In this study, we address existing factors that impact the adoption of technological intervention and design an effective technological intervention for ADHD children in Bangladesh.

### Semi-Structured Interview
Before designing the intervention, we conducted a semi-structured interview with parents of ADHD children and professional caregivers. By conducting this experiment, we found out:
+ parental attitude and belief toward ADHD and its interventions 
+ valuable insights about existing cultural barriers and societal norms
+ parental concenrns and expectations regarding technological interventions

### Thematic Analysis
We analyzed the insights that we gained from the experiment conducted  earlier using thematic analysis approach. This strategy helped us to propose design challenges of implementing an effective technological intervention by breaking cultural barriers. We also present some considerations associated with the design challenges.

### Work In Progress
The journey is far from over. Designing and implementing the intervention remains a work in progress.

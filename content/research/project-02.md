### Overview

In the enchanting realm where Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) meets the captivating tapestry of neurodiversity, our research project, "Unraveling the Intersection of HCI and Neurodiversity in Bangladesh," seeks to illuminate new pathways of understanding and support for individuals with Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD).

### Semi-Structured Interviews: 
As explorers of human experiences, we embarked on a journey of discovery. Through semi-structured interviews with parents of children with ADHD and expert caregivers, we navigated the intricate web of attitudes, beliefs, and lived realities surrounding ADHD within the Bangladeshi cultural context.

### Cultural Perspectives: 
Our quest extended to uncover the unique cultural perspectives that shape the perception of ADHD in Bangladesh. By delving deep into the rich tapestry of traditions, we gained invaluable insights into the intricate interplay between neurodiversity and cultural dynamics.

### Technology-Based Interventions: 
With a mission to bridge knowledge into action, we set the stage for pioneering technology-based interventions. Our project not only identifies key challenges but also proposes innovative design considerations for an e-learning-based technological intervention tailored to the needs of individuals with ADHD in Bangladesh.

### Ongoing Progress: 
The journey is far from over. Designing and implementing the intervention remains a work in progress, driven by our commitment to creating tangible solutions that empower individuals with ADHD, their families, and their communities.

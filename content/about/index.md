Hey there! ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m a final year undergraduate student at [SUST](https://www.sust.edu/), studying Computer Science and Engineering.

My primary interest lies in **Human-Computer Interaction (HCI)** research, where I am currently exploring ways to improve computer systems for neurodivergent usergroup.
Iâ€™m also fascinated by **Machine Learning (ML)** systems and how they can enhance HCI.

You can check out my [GitHub](https://github.com/thisisjibon) profile for some cool side projects Iâ€™ve worked on.

When Iâ€™m not geeking out over tech, youâ€™ll find me listening to alternative rock music, binge-watching captivating TV dramas, or cheering for my favorite football team.

Letâ€™s connect and make a positive impact together! âš¡

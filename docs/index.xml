      <description>Overview Music Genre Classification holds significant importance in the context of music content distribution platforms. In this study, we present BanglaBeats, a comprehensive dataset of Bengali songs. We also propose a CNN-based approach that surpasses previous CNN-based Bangla music genre classification approaches in terms of accuracy. We did not stop here. We explored the possibility of transformer-based approaches for Bengali music genre classification tasks. We fine-tuned DistiHubert and Wav2-Vec2-Base-960h models. Our results reveal that further optimization techniques can enhance this task.</description>

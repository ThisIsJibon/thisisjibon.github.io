      <description>Hey there! ðŸ‘‹
Iâ€™m a final year undergraduate student at SUST, studying Computer Science and Engineering.
My primary interest lies in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) research, where I am currently exploring ways to improve computer systems for neurodivergent usergroup. Iâ€™m also fascinated by Machine Learning (ML) systems and how they can enhance HCI.
You can check out my GitHub profile for some cool side projects Iâ€™ve worked on.
When Iâ€™m not geeking out over tech, youâ€™ll find me listening to alternative rock music, binge-watching captivating TV dramas, or cheering for my favorite football team.</description>
